# Drink-Smart

Project for a smart scale mainly designed to keep track of drinking volume during the day

## Development environment setup

### Code formatter

As a code formatter we use uncrustify as it's highly customizable. See [devtools/formatter/README.md](devtools/formatter/README.md) for more information.

### PlatformIO
This project was setup with platformIO. To install it, follow the instructions on the [platformIO website](https://platformio.org/install/cli).

In short: platformIO is a plugin for Visual Studio Code. It is a build system for embedded systems and IoT and can be directly integrated into VS Code via the platformIO extension. Since code formatter settings are stored in the `.vscode/settings.json` file, it is recommended to use VS Code as the IDE.
