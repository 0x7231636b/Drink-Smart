To  start the script, cd into the devtools/formatter folder and run ./uncrustify.sh.
Code formatting changes can be done before a commit is happening. You can also
use the uncrustify.cfg with your IDE auto formatter or trigger the uncrustify.sh 
as a pre commit hook.

uncrustify.cfg tested with uncrustify version 0.69. Changes for newer versions are welcome.
